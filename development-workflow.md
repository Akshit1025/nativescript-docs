## Running on Virtual Device

### Android Emulators

Apart from using real Android devices, a viable option is to download, install and use an Android emulator.
In NativeScript, we can use all Android emulators that are connected and recognized by the `ns device` command.

Example output from `ns device`

```
$ ns device

::: tip Tip
Sometimes emulators take longer to start. As a recommendation and to avoid timing issues, start the emulator before executing other CLI commands. Once the emulator is started, leave it open to avoid the initial load time the next time you need to deploy an Android application.

#### Creating Android Virtual Device via Android Studio

Follow the official documentation on [Creating and Managing Virtual Devices](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html), where the process of downloading, setting up, and using Android Emulators via Android Studio is covered.

#### Creating Android Virtual Device via command line tool

The `avdmanager` is a tool that allows you to create and manage Android Virtual Devices (AVDs) from the command line. The `avdmanager` is provided in the Android SDK Tools package (25.3.0 and higher) and is located in `<ANDROID_HOME_PATH_HERE>/tools/bin/`. For more information about the avdmanager and how to use it to create AVDs, see the [official avdmanager documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/avdmanager.html).

Command syntax to create new AVD

```Shell
$ cd $ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
$ avdmanager create avd -n name -k "sdk_id" [-c {path|size}] [-f] [-p path]
```

You must provide a name for the AVD and specify the ID of the SDK package to use for the AVD using sdk_id wrapped in quotes.
For example, the following command creates an AVD named `test` using the x86 system image for API level 25:

```Shell
avdmanager create avd -n test -k "system-images;android-25;google_apis;x86"
```

::: warning Note
The above command suggest that the system image is already downloaded. To download an image use the `sdkmanager`. For example `sdkmanager "system-images;android-25;google_apis;x86"`
:::

The following describes the usages for the other options:
-c {path|size}: The path to the SD card image for this AVD or the size of a new SD card image to create for this AVD, in KB or MB, denoted with K or M. For example, -c path/to/sdcard/ or -c 1000M.
-f: Force creation of the AVD. Use this option if you need to overwrite an existing AVD with a new AVD using the same name.
-p path: Path to the location where the directory for this AVD's files will be created. If you do not specify a path, the AVD will be created in ~/.android/avd/.

To list all the downloaded system images use the `list` command.

```Shell
avdmanager list
```

#### Using third-party emulators

An applicable option is to use third-party emulators (like **GenyMotion**).
Visit the official sites for details on how to install and use these emulators.

### iOS Simulators

#### Creating iOS Simulators

The iOS simulator emulates iOS devices on Macs. The following documentation is a quick way to get the iOS simulator set up. For more information, see [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/simulator_help_topics/Chapter/Chapter.html).

#### Running on iOS Simualators

On a mac if you have XCode installed with the proper tools, executing `ns run ios` from your terminal will launch the Simulator program with a default device. Alternatively, you can open the Simulator program on your mac, select which device(s) you want to open by navigating to `File -> Open Simulator` and choosing the device to launch. Then execute `ns run ios` and the NativeScript app will launch on the open simulator(s).

## Running on Physical Device

### Android Devices

---

#### Enable Debugging over USB

Most Android devices can only install and run apps downloaded from Google Play, by default. You will need to enable USB Debugging on your device in order to install your app during development.

To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the "Developer options" menu by going to Settings → About phone → Software information and then tapping the Build number row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to Settings → Developer options to enable "USB debugging".

#### Plug in your device via USB

Let's now set up an Android device to run our NativeScript projects. Go ahead and plug in your device via USB to your development machine.

Now check that your device is properly connecting to ADB, the Android Debug Bridge, by running adb devices.

```shell
adb devices
```

The device should be listed. See the full [adb documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) for troubleshooting and detailed information.

#### Run your app

Type the following in your command prompt to install and launch your app on the device:

```shell
ns run android
```

### iOS Devices

---

#### Plug in your device via USB

Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB to Lightning cable. Navigate to the `ios` folder in your project under `platforms`, then open the `.xcodeproj` file, or if you are using CocoaPods open `.xcworkspace`, within it using Xcode.

If this is your first time running an app on your iOS device, you may need to register your device for development. Open the Product menu from Xcode's menubar, then go to Destination. Look for and select your device from the list. Xcode will then register your device for development.

#### Configure code signing

Register for an Apple developer account if you don't have one yet.

Select your project in the Xcode Project Navigator, then select your main target (it should share the same name as your project). Look for the "General" tab. Go to "Signing" and make sure your Apple developer account or team is selected under the Team dropdown. Do the same for the tests target (it ends with Tests, and is below your main target).

#### Run your app

If the device is now registered with your developer account you should be able to run your NativeScript app on the device. Execute the following from your terminal to run the app from the CLI:

```shell
ns run ios
```

The app should install and launch on the connected iOS device.

Alternatively, once you have the NativeScript project built, you can open open the native project inside XCode by opening the `.xcworkspace` or `.xcproject` file from XCode's menu and then running on a connected device or simulator.
